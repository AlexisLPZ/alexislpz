# Hi there 👋, my name is Alexis Lerendu-Pernez

## 🙋‍♂️ About me

I'm from France 🇫🇷, currently in Paris 🌎. I'm a big fan of Python 🐍 and Django. I'm also really keen on energy-efficient building renovation 🏗️. When I'm not behind my computer 💻, I can be found spending time with my girlfriend ❤️, family and friends, or playing touch rugby 🏉.

## 🔭 I'm currently working on

[www.mon-dpe.net](https://www.mon-dpe.net/), which is a website that lets you estimate the energy consumption of an apartment or house.
